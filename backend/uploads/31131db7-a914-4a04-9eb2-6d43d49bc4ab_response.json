  "summary": "This is a pathology lab report for Priya Iyer, aged 32, conducted at DRLOGY PATHOLOGY LAB. The report includes a Complete Blood Count (CBC) test. The results indicate mild anemia with low hemoglobin, RBC count, and PCV. Elevated RDW and slightly high basophils are noted, suggesting red cell size variability and minor inflammatory response. Further clinical correlation is recommended.",
