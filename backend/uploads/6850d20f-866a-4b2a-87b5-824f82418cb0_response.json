  "summary": "This document is a tutorial on high-performance computing, focusing on parallelizing an assignment problem. It includes C code with OpenMP directives for parallel execution of matrix operations such as dot product, matrix multiplication, and transposition. The document also covers calculating mean squared error and includes utilities for random number generation and weight initialization in neural networks. Finally, it presents results of thread vs time analysis to estimate the parallelization fraction based on Amdahl's Law.",
